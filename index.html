        <p><h3><br>Improve the education system</h3> <br>
            <b>Why the creation of the website?</b> <br>
            <br>
            <p>Both the education of before and that of today has shown that it does not develop or stimulate the fruit in students, this due to the 
            orthodox teaching system that is present in schools. That is why the initiative to make a change came about by creating a right and fighting 
            for it, in addition to making it known through this website.</p>

        <p><h3><br>More time to rest.</h3><br>
            <b>What is the main cause?</b><br>
            <br>
            <p>This thinking is generated through the types of teachings given by public school teachers, since in the
             The vast majority of these educational centers continue to be very routine and archaic, thus affecting the maximum use
             of their techniques and by restricting their development, we are losing a great potential that would improve the quality of the professionals of the future.</p>

        <p><h3><br>Better mental health</h3><br>
             <b>Why is this the main cause?</b>
             <br>
             <br><p>The way in which teachers develop psychological affectations to students (Stress, anxiety, among others.) Is by leaving them without
                free time, which they could use to reflect, sleep, rest, recreate, among other activities. This usually happens due to the overexploitation of tasks
                (Exercises, investigations, among other assignments) that teachers assign to students.</p>
